Test Strategy for Sauce Labs Website
    1. Objectives
        1. Ensure that the Sauce Labs website meets functional, usability, performance, and security requirements.
        2. Provide seamless user experiences across all pages and functionalities.
        3. Maintain traceability between requirements, test cases, and defects.

    2. Scope
    The test strategy will cover:
        • Login Page: Validation of login functionality for different user types.
        • Product Listing Page: Verification of product sorting and item details.
        • Cart Page: Verification of the added products and checking cart functionalities, such as removing items.
        • Checkout Process: Ensuring accurate user details input, payment details, shipping details, summary display and total calculations.
        • Navigation and Usability: Testing the side menu and overall user flow.


    3. Testing Types
    Manual Testing:
        • Usability and UI consistency across devices and browsers.
        • Exploratory testing to uncover edge cases.
        • Accessibility testing.
    Automation Testing:
        • Regression testing for repeated scenarios (e.g., login, adding items to cart).
        • API testing (if applicable) for backend functionalities.
        • Cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.
    Performance Testing:
        • Measure page load times and responsiveness under varying loads.
        • Ensure the site functions smoothly under high traffic.
    Security Testing:
        • Validate authentication.
        • Test for vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

    4. Traceability
        • Map test cases to user stories, requirements and defects found.
        • Maintain a traceability matrix for coverage (e.g., Login > Test Cases > Defects Found).

    5. Test Environment
        • Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
        • Devices: Desktop, tablets, and mobile devices.
        • Test Data: Cover standard, edge, and negative scenarios for user inputs and flows.

    6. Defect Management
        • Categorize defects by severity (Critical, Major, Minor).
        • Track defects via a tool like JIRA or Trello.
        
    7. Metrics for Quality
        • Test coverage percentage.
        • Defect leakage rate post-deployment.
        • Time taken for defect resolution.


Top 3 Most Important Features:
    1. Login functionality: Ensures only authenticated users access the website and different roles are handled correctly.
    2. Checkout flow: Accuracy in calculating totals, capturing user information, and completing orders is critical.
    3. Cart operations: Seamless adding, updating, and removing of products directly impacts the user's shopping experience.

Top 3 Least Important Features:
    1. Side menu (e.g., 'About' or 'Reset App State'): These are secondary and not critical for the main flow.
    2. Low-priority UI elements (like footer links): While still important, they have less impact on core functionalities.
    3. Sorting functionality: Valuable but not mission-critical compared to ensuring items can be purchased.
